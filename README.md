# Tempo Run 🏃‍♀️🏃‍♂️

Spotify produces several running playlists for common running cadences (e.g. 150bpm, 160bpm etc), however they often vary wildly in tempo. Being forced to run out of sync with the music is not ideal. An even worse option is to recalibrate your cadence and speed up or slow down to stay in time with the music. Either way, your flow is ruined.

This app allows you to create custom Spotify playlists uniquely generated based on a selection of artists and energy profile that match your target tempo.
